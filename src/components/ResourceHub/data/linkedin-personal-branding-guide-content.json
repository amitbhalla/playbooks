The algorithm favors content that generates meaningful conversations and keeps users on the platform rather than linking elsewhere.",

Consider notifying key connections when you post important content to jump-start engagement. Avoid external links in your main post (put them in the comments instead) as LinkedIn deprioritizes content that takes users off-platform.",
